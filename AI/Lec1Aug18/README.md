## Topics

- Introductory Concepts
- Intelligence definition
  - Artificial Intelligence
- History of AI
- Core Concepts
  - Search  
    - algos
    - search capacity
    - tool for prob solving
    - Heuristics search
      - heuristic = rule
      - allows to follow rule blindly
      - and if u follow it, most of times, u will achieve goal u set
      - eg: if I am lost, I will always move North
  - Representation
  - Uncertainity
    - concept of probability - Bayes thm, conditional prob, etc
    - Markov Decision process
- Success Stories
- Where are we headed?
  - Private AI - privacy concerns
  - Edge AI - doing AI using edge devices (Smartphones, etc)

## 2001: The space odyessey

- Science fiction movie

## The Turing test

- machine made by IBM which defeated then Chess Champion
- machine = deep blue

## Chatbots

- Alexa, Siri, Cortona

## Games

- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Dots & Boxes
- Adverserial Game playing

## What is Intelligence

- The capacity to learn and solve problems (**Websters Dictionary**)
- the ability to solve novel problems
- act rationally
- act like humans
- ***Ability to generalize***
  - There is a test on some topics
  - and some practice probs are given
  - Solving those, u learn some tricks/ways to solve the probs
  - and if u solve all these, u r likely to solve probs coming in exams

## What is Artificial Intelligence

- making computers that think
- the automation of activities we associate with human thinking like **decision making, learning**
- art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by ppl
- the study of mental faculties through the use of computational models

## Other Disciplines

![disc](disc.png)

## Building Systems that act like humans : Turing Test

![turing](turing.png)

- Deep Blue has been trained to play chess
- we r building systems which are specialized : can do one particular thing

![ttest](ttest.png)

## Systems that act like humans

- Turing test scenario

![tt](ttprob.png)

- Subtle point is what questions you asked

## Solving the Turing Test : Eliza

![eliza](eliza.png)

- ALICE

![alice](alice.png)

- alice has memory

- Alice vs Eliza

## HAL

![hal](hal.png)

## Components reqd to build a smart cmputer

- Fast hardware
  - as fast as human brain
- Foolproof Software
  - bug-free s/w
- can it play chess at grandmaster level
- speech interaction?
  - speech synthesis
  - recognition
  - understanding
- image recognition and understanding
- learning?
- planning and decision-making?

## Evaluatives

- 3 tests
- an assignment or quiz
- compre
