## Q-learning

- come up with reward and policy
- take seq of decision
- so that it is maximized by Q function
- reward depends upon game

## Inverse RL

- learning reward by observing an agent who is doing things in right way
- and ek bar reward a gaya, tab policy nikal sakta

## Supervised Learning

- student ka ht,wt,age tuple vs time to run 100m ka data hai
- given a new student classify how good he is
- this is supervised
- classification
- regression
- trying to learn a function to do classification or regression
