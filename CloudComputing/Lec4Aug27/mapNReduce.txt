map():
    # assuming n users, and m machines m << n
    within the machine combine all occurences of a particular user_num by adding the num_followers
    at the end, u have in a machine, a set of <user_num, num_followers>
    map each entry to a machine by using say a hash function user_num % m

reduce():
    for each user_num in list:
        if user_num is not in output list:
            add to output list entry <user_num, 0>
        add num_followers to entry in output list corresponding to user_num
    in the end u get a list of <user_num, num_followers> where each user_num is distinct in the list
