# Lecture 2

- We acheive *Abstraction* using *Encapsulation*
- Also, we do *Data hiding* using *Encapsulation*
- *Inheritance* allows to do *Code reusability*
  - represented by *IS-A* relationship
  - There is a **Generalized class** and a **Specialized class**
    - specialized class *IS-A* generalized class
- *Polymorphism* - same name different forms
  - Method overloaidng, overriding

## Analysis and Design

- Design is talking about solution part
  - How part of it
  - independent of any prog lang
- analysis is talking about problem part
  - What part of it
- Firstly we do analysis to understand the problem in hand
- now, we think about
- In analysis, there would be some challenges, but there would be domain experts there
  - technical skills would not be required too much
  - understanding capabilities etc will be required there
- Design is more challenging
  - You need to check all possible solutions
  - and pick up the best solution possible
